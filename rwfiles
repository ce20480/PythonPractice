how to read and write from files 
open(file_path, mode_specifier)
close - not automatically closed, risk of overwriting, saves changes to file, depending on OS might not be able to read and write file while opening
r: open an existing file to read
r+:(+ means read and write) open a text file to read from or write to(file must already exist and if file exists over-writes previous contents)
w: open an existing file to write to, if no file exists: craetes a new file, if file exits: over-writes previous contents
w+: same as w pretty much
a: open an existing file to write to, f no file exists: creates a new file, if file exists: append text to end of file
a+: open a text file to read from or write to, if no file exists: creates new file, if file exists: appends text to end of file
for file paths:
    ../ lets you go back a folder this allows you to find out where the other file is 
    example if its in a neighbour folder: open(../Folder_name/File_name, 'w')
    example if its one tier up: open(.../File_name, 'w')
